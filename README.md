🧠 Tumor Detection using YOLOv11 & SAM2
This repository contains the implementation of Manual-1 Category B Task 1: Brain Tumor Segmentation using YOLOv11 and SAM2 models.

The project leverages state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation techniques to accurately identify and segment brain tumors in medical images.

🔍 Overview
This project involves two key components:

YOLOv11
A cutting-edge, real-time object detection model capable of identifying multiple objects in an image with high speed and accuracy.

SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2)
A powerful segmentation model designed for fine-grained object separation, enabling precise localization of tumor regions.

Image Segmentation
A process of dividing an image into meaningful segments (regions), making it easier to detect and analyze objects of interest — in this case, brain tumors.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is publicly available on Roboflow:
